CaffeineMate prevents your Mac from going to sleep using the same APIs as the built-in `caffeinate` command-line tool.

**When active:**

- Your system **always stays awake** (equivalent to `caffeinate -i`)
- Optionally keep your **display awake** too (equivalent to `caffeinate -i -d`)

## Features

- **One-click toggle** - Left-click the menu bar icon to activate/deactivate
- **Optional display awake** - Check "Keep Display Awake" to prevent screen from sleeping
- **Duration options** - Set a timer (15 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, custom, or indefinite)
- **Live countdown** - See remaining time in the menu bar
- **Global keyboard shortcut** - Toggle from anywhere
- **Launch at login** - Start automatically when you log in (macOS 13+)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip and move `CaffeineMate.app` to your Applications folder
3. **Right-click** the app and select **"Open"** (required for unsigned apps)
